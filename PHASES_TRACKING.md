## 🎯 **PHASE 1: Core Foundation + Real Liquid Glass UI**
*Status: 🧪 IMPLEMENTED - NEEDS TESTING*

### ✅ **Completed Foundation:**
- [x] SwiftData models and persistence  
- [x] Basic MVC architecture
- [x] Note CRUD operations (create, edit, delete, swipe-to-delete)
- [x] Basic widget working (all sizes, sample data)
- [x] App builds and launches successfully
- [x] Emoji support in text fields
- [x] Clean note editor UI (no confusing titles)

### ✅ **PRIORITY 1: Apple Liquid Glass Implementation**
- [x] **1a**: Research Apple's official Liquid Glass documentation
- [x] **1b**: Implement real Apple Liquid Glass using system materials
- [x] **1c**: Replace custom effects with standard SwiftUI components
- [x] **1d**: Remove theme selection - focus on single system glass
- [x] **1e**: Apply system materials to all UI elements (notes, buttons, backgrounds)

**Key Insight**: Apple's Liquid Glass comes automatically when using standard SwiftUI components with latest SDKs. Custom themes moved to later phase.

**Implementation Status**: ✅ Code complete - awaiting build/test verification

### ⚡ **PRIORITY 2: Essential UX Features** *(Next Sprint)*
- [ ] **2a**: Add search bar with real-time filtering and highlights
- [ ] **2b**: Implement note pinning functionality (UI exists, needs wiring)
- [ ] **2c**: Add note sorting options (date, pinned, alphabetical)
- [ ] **2d**: Polish note editor with additional features

### 🎨 **PRIORITY 3: Core Glass Themes** 
**MOVED TO PHASE 2** - Focus on Apple's system glass first
- [ ] **3a**: Custom theme system (later phase)
- [ ] **3b**: Multiple glass appearances (later phase)
- [ ] **3c**: Theme customization (later phase)
- [ ] **3d**: Advanced visual effects (later phase)

### 📱 **Widget Polish**
- [x] Basic widget with sample data working
- [x] **4a**: System materials for authentic glass effects in widget
- [x] **4b**: Removed fake placeholder notes
- [ ] **4c**: Connect widget to real SwiftData notes

## 🚀 **PHASE 2: Spatial Organization + Advanced Glass**
*Status: PLANNED*

### 🌌 **Spatial Canvas Features** (Advanced UI)
- [ ] **S1**: Free-form note positioning on infinite canvas
- [ ] **S2**: Drag and drop with physics-based movement
- [ ] **S3**: Pinch to zoom canvas view
- [ ] **S4**: Rotate to reorganize gesture controls
- [ ] **S5**: Z-depth layering (important notes come forward)
- [ ] **S6**: Magnetic clustering (related notes attract each other)

### ✨ **Advanced Glass Effects** (Motion + Dynamic)
- [ ] **G1**: Motion response with device gyroscope  
- [ ] **G2**: Dynamic lighting and specular highlights
- [ ] **G3**: Content-adaptive opacity (based on text length)
- [ ] **G4**: Time-based glass tinting (day/night adaptation)
- [ ] **G5**: Environmental awareness (wallpaper reflection)

### 🔗 **Widget Data Integration**
- [ ] **W1**: App Groups setup for shared data container
- [ ] **W2**: SwiftData configuration for widget extension
- [ ] **W3**: Real notes displayed in widget (not sample data)
- [ ] **W4**: Widget timeline updates when notes change
- [ ] **W5**: Widget tap actions to open specific notes

### 🔧 **Infrastructure Improvements**
- [ ] **I1**: CloudKit conflict resolution improvements
- [ ] **I2**: Performance optimization for large note counts
- [ ] **I3**: Background sync and processing
- [ ] **I4**: Error handling and recovery
