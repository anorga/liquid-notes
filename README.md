# Liquid Notes

A modern sticky notes app for iOS that leverages Apple's Liquid Glass design language to create translucent, interactive notes with motion-responsive glass materials.

## Technical Overview

**Platform**: iOS 17.0+, iPadOS 17.0+  
**Language**: Swift 5.9+  
**UI Framework**: SwiftUI 5.0+  
**Architecture**: MVVM with SwiftData + CloudKit

## Core Technologies

- **SwiftUI** with Liquid Glass APIs for glass effects
- **SwiftData** for local data persistence 
- **CloudKit** for cross-device synchronization
- **Core Motion** for device orientation tracking
- **Core Animation** for smooth transitions and effects

## Key Features

### Glass Material System
- Translucent notes with dynamic opacity and blur effects
- Motion-responsive materials that react to device orientation
- Multiple glass themes with different visual properties
- Performance-optimized rendering at 60fps

### Spatial Organization
- Free-form note positioning on infinite canvas
- Physics-based drag and drop interactions
- Magnetic clustering for related notes
- Z-depth layering with visual hierarchy

### Data Architecture
- SwiftData models with CloudKit integration
- Automatic sync across user's devices
- Offline-first design with conflict resolution
- Encrypted storage and transmission

## Development Setup

1. **Requirements**
   - Xcode 15.0+
   - iOS 17.0+ deployment target
   - iCloud account for CloudKit testing

2. **Build Configuration**
   - Target: iPhone and iPad
   - Swift version: 5.9
   - Deployment target: iOS 17.0

3. **Dependencies**
   - No third-party libraries required
   - Uses only Apple's native frameworks

## Core Implementation

### Glass Effect System
Notes utilize custom glass materials that respond to device motion and adapt based on content length and context.

### Motion Tracking
Core Motion integration provides real-time device orientation data to create subtle parallax and lighting effects on glass materials.

### Data Persistence
SwiftData handles local storage with automatic CloudKit synchronization for seamless cross-device experience.

## Performance Targets

- **Launch time**: < 2 seconds cold start
- **Note creation**: < 100ms response time  
- **Animations**: Consistent 60fps
- **Memory usage**: < 40MB for 100 notes
- **Battery impact**: Minimal with optimized motion tracking

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
- SwiftData models and basic CRUD operations
- Simple UI with standard materials
- Local persistence

### Phase 2: Glass Implementation  
- Liquid Glass view components
- Motion tracking integration
- Basic glass themes

### Phase 3: Spatial Features
- Free-form positioning
- Gesture recognition
- Canvas navigation

### Phase 4: Cloud Integration
- CloudKit configuration
- Sync validation
- Performance optimization

## Testing

- Unit tests for data models and business logic
- UI tests for user interaction flows
- Performance testing for animation smoothness
- CloudKit sync scenario testing

## Security & Privacy

- All data encrypted at rest and in transit
- No user analytics or tracking
- Privacy-focused design with minimal data collection
- SwiftData automatic encryption
